    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <p>
    Lasagna is a classic, comforting baked pasta dish made with layers of flat pasta sheets, a rich and savory meat-based tomato sauce, and a creamy cheese filling. The combination of slow-simmered sauce, soft pasta, and melted cheeses creates a hearty, satisfying meal that’s both filling and deeply flavorful </p>

    <p>
    It’s known for its warm, homestyle feel and is often served as a main dish for family dinners or gatherings. With its balanced mix of protein, sauce, and cheese, lasagna is a timeless recipe that feels indulgent yet familiar, and it’s just as good reheated the next day.
